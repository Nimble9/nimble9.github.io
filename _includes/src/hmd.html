                    With the IPD Control Wheel, you can fine-tune your view to best fit your own eyes ― because when it comes to viewing, one size does not fit all! Simply move the IPD Control wheel until you find the perfect balance for your eyes. Line up the two lenses for the best possible view – and more comfortable, more lifelike MR experiences on your Samsung HMD Odyssey.
