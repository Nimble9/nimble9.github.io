The slim design made it possible to equip existing seatbacks with minimal modification, satisfying FAA requirements. By using Knox Customization to restrict usage of the device features, Mezzoglobal was also able to prevent improper use of content and gain full control of the tablet, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations.</p>

                                            <p>By replacing the existing legacy inflight entertainment systems with a new streamlined tablet solution, Mezzoglobal could reduce the weight of each seat by 2-4 kg, saving the airline tens of millions of dollars per plane in fuel costs annually. The Mezzoglobal solution on Samsung Tab PRO also gets Hollywood’s stamp of approval for security, which allows airlines to show “early-window” content such as movies not yet out on DVD. Customers can securely enjoy viewing a wide array of premium entertainment content on a stunning, high-resolution screen.</p>
